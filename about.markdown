Welcome to Escape To the Kitchen! Right now this website is about food. I hope
to help make cooking an enjoyable activity for everyone. Some people (in my
opinion) overcomplicate cooking with all these rules and exact measurements and
the belief that you always have to have correct ingredients. But here is the
truth. That kind of thinking can be stressful and make cooking intimidating. And
besides, a dish will never taste exactly the same twice because it will never be
those exact ingredients again. This is about cooking from scratch(ish) the easy
way to make delicious home-cooked meals.
