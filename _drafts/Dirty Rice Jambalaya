My take on Jambalaya.

Ingredients ( Makes about 4 servings)

* 1/2 lb of sausage
*1/2 lb of ground beef
* 1/2 lb of kielbasa
* 1 lb of shrimp
* 1 yellow pepper
* 1 red pepper
* 1 green pepper
* 1 1/2 onions
* 4 tsp minced garlic
* 4 small tomatoes
* 2 cups rice
* 4 cups bone broth
* 2 tbsp worcheshire sauce
* chili powder
* black pepper
* salt
* paprika
* italian seasoning
* fresh herbs thyme,oregano, sage, basil

Directions

1.  Put bone broth/ stock in a pot and add about half the water. Bring to boil.
2.  While thats coming to a boil, either shred or finely dice your onions,
    carrots, and potatoes.
3.  Add vegetables to pot. When it is boiling reduce to a simmer.
4.  Add pumpkin, garlic, and the rest of the water.
5.  Cook a little while. ( about 10 minutes)
6.  Add cream and stir thouroughly adding salt and pepper to taste. Start with
    about 1/4 tsp of each). Make sure its cooking on low. Cook for about 20
    minutes.
7.  If you aren't a vegetarian/ have bacon and want to eat it, while the soup
    is simmering, cook up little pieces of bacon in a pan and pour the bacon
    fat into the soup.
8.  By this time the soup should be done. Taste it. Is it delicious? If not add
    salt/pepper/cream until its delicious.
9.  Serve in a bowl and sprinkle little pieces of bacon on top (if you made
    some). If you want to be fancy you can also add a dollop of sour
    cream/cream fraiche and chives/parsely on top.
10. Enjoy!

Yum!
