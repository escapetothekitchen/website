Ingredients
Cooking spray for the pan (I use avocado oil spray)
▢3 large eggs
▢3 large very ripe bananas well mashed (1.5 cups)
▢1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1/3 coconut sugar
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
▢1 cup blanched finely ground almond flour (8 oz)*
* 1 cup flour
* tbsp butter, melted
▢1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
▢¼ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
▢1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 cup walnuts, crushed
* 1/4 cup chocolate chips

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line a small loaf pan (8.5 X 4.5 inches) with parchment paper strips, leaving an overhang on each side of the pan. Lightly spray the lined pan with oil.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, mashed bananas, vanilla, and sweetener.
Gradually whisk in the almond flour, cinnamon, kosher salt, and finally the baking soda. Whisk until smooth.
Using a rubber spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Gently tap the pan on the counter top to evenly distribute the batter.
Bake the banana bread until browned and set, and a toothpick inserted in its center comes out dry, 40-50 minutes.
Using the excess parchment paper as handles, carefully remove the banana bread from the pan and transfer it to a wire rack. Carefully remove the parchment, to allow air to circulate.
Cool the bread completely on the cooling rack, about 2 hours. Slice it into 12 slices and serve.
