The way most people make them they are pretty meh and I don't understand why anyone likes them. In contrast these deviled eggs are badass and loaded. Do not bring to any event where someone else also is bringing deviled eggs because these will be  som much better than theirs that it will make them feel bad and no one wants that.\n\nIngredients:\n* 10 eggs\n* some mayonnaise (Duke's is the best)\n* 1 tsp grassfed butter\n* 1 tsp dijon mustard\n* 2 tbsp relish\n* 1/4 of finely minced sweet onion\n* salt to taste\n* pepper to taste\n* paprika to taste\n* 1 tsp white vinegar\n\nDirections:\n1.

Sometimes I\nhave them and I think meh\"\" but other times I have them and they are delicious.\"\n\nWith this recipe I think I've finally identified what can make them delicious\nevery time. One concern with beans is upset stomach and gas. Other people are\nconcerned about the phytic acid content of beans. With this recipe\nbeans for 24 hours and changing the water helps eliminate this problem.  Cooking\nin a pressure cooker also helps with the breakdown of them as well. I am able to\neat these beans with no tummy troubles at all.\n\nIngredients\n\n* 2 cups of dried black beans\n* 8 oz chicken bone broth (can substitute vegetable broth for vegetarian dish)\n* 1 bell pepper (Get creative here! Use green\n  peppers or a combination of several)\n* 1 small onion\n* ~ tbsp olive oil\n* 1 tbsp cumin\n* 1 clove of minced garlic\n* 1 tsp salt ( or to taste)\n* 1/2 tsp pepper ( or to taste)\n* 1 bay leaf\n\nFor spicy beans:\n\n* can of chili peppers\n\nTopping:\n\n* sour cream or cheese!\n\nDirections\n\n1. Put dried black beans in a bowl and cover in filtered clean water. Soak for\n   24 hours\n2. Put olive oil in bottom of pressure cooker pot so beans don't stick. Pour\n   your black beans in a presure cooker (I use a instapot\n   cooker will work). Add in peppers\n   seasonings and cover with water.\n3. Cook for about 10 minutes under pressure.\n4. Remove lid and continue to cook on low until it has thickened up and is\n   right consistency.\n5. Enjoy with sour cream on top. If you want them spicy then add a can of green\n   chilis or some hot sauce.\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"banana-nut-bread","slug":"banana-nut-bread","title":"Banana Nut Bread","date":"2020-10-06T04:00:00.000Z","categories":["bread"],"description":"Ingredients","body":"Ingredients\n\n* Cooking spray for the pan (I use avocado oil spray)\n* 3 large really ripe bananas \n* 1 cup blanched almond flour\n* 1 cup flour\n* 3 large eggs\n* 1/3 coconut sugar\n* 1/3 cup brown sugar\n* 2 tbsp butter, melted\n* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon \n* 2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1/4 cup walnuts, crushed\n* 1/4 cup chocolate chips\n\nDirections\n\n1.

I feel fancy making it. I feel fancy eating it. And I feel\nfancy telling other people that it's what I made for lunch/dinner. It's great for\nwhen you have zucchini but really just wish you could have lasagna instead\nbecause it does taste vaguely like a weird eggy lasagna.\n\nIngredients for Zucchini Flan\n* 3 medium sized zucchini\n* 4 green onions\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 4 eggs\n* 1 cup sour cream (can use creme fraiche if you want a creamier flavor and can\n  actually find it at your grocery store)\n* 1/2 tsp salt\n* 1/4 tsp nutmeg\n* 1/2 cup of grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese\n\nIngredients for Tomato Coulis\n* 2 ripe tomatoes\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 1 bay leaves\n* 1 clove garlic (~1 heaping tsp of minced garlic)\n* 1/2 tsp thyme\n* 1/2 basil\n* 1 tbsp honey (can also use sugar if making for a baby who can't have honey or\n  just leave out the sweetener all together if your tomatoes are sweet)\n* small handful of parsley\n* salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n\nHow to Make Zucchini Flan\n1. Steam your zucchini. There are lots of ways to do do this. I bring a little\n   bit of water to boil in a pot then insert a steamer basket with my zucchini\n   in it.\n2. Slice up your zucchini very thin.\n3. To make filling, cut up green onion very small and saute them with olive oil\n   until the pan sizzles slightly(this should be pretty short) and then turn\n   off and let cool by just abandoning the entire recipe and going and doing\n   something else (like making the tomato coulis).\n4. When its cool mix together green onions, olive oil, eggs, sour cream, salt\n   and nutmeg.\n5. Put wax paper in your casserole dish and spray so it doesn't stick.\n6. Place thin slices of zucchini until it covers the dish in one layer and\n   cover by pouring a thin layer of egg and creme mixture on top of it. Add\n   another layer of zucchini and cover with egg and creme mixture. Keep doing\n   this until you are out of zucchini. I usually do about 2.8 layers with not\n   quite enough zucchini to do a complete 3rd layer and then just pour the rest\n   of the creme mixture over the top.\n7. Spread cheese over the top of this.\n8. Put in oven and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30-40 minutes. Its done\n   when the cheese is slightly light brown and your mouth is watering.\n\nHow to Make the Tomato Coulis\n1. Dice tomatoes and put in saucepan with olive oil on stove.\n2. Add the other ingredients.\n3. Warm up the pan until it seems that the contents are hot. Then turn off and\n   remove from heat. Let cool. You don't want to cook it too much because then\n   it gets too mushy we just want it slightly cooked.\n4. Serve this on top of the zucchini flan and place a little bit of parsley on\n   top to make it look great.\n\nHow to Serve\nI like to serve this with the zucchini flan warm and the Tomato coulis not warm\nbut eat it whatever temperature you want really. If anyone objects about the\ntemperature of the food confidently tell them that its supposed to be served\nthat temperature. Cut a piece of the zucchini flan and then spoon a little bit\nof Tomato Coulis on top. Then sprinkle/arrange the parsley on top and admire\nyour zucchini flan.\n\n\n"},{"id":"buckwheat-bread","slug":"buckwheat-bread","title":"Buckwheat Bread","date":"2020-09-15T04:00:00.000Z","categories":["bread","snack"],"description":"","body":"![](/assets/images/buckwheat_bread.jpg)\n\nI've been trying to find the perfect buckwheat bread.
