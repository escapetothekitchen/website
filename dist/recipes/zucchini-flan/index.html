<p>This recipe is fancy. I feel fancy making it. I feel fancy eating it. And I feel
fancy telling other people that it’s what I made for lunch/dinner. It’s great for
when you have zucchini but really just wish you could have lasagna instead
because it does taste vaguely like a weird eggy lasagna.</p>
<p>Ingredients for Zucchini Flan</p>
<ul>
<li>3 medium sized zucchini</li>
<li>4 green onions</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>1 cup sour cream (can use creme fraiche if you want a creamier flavor and can
actually find it at your grocery store)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 cup of grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>Ingredients for Tomato Coulis</p>
<ul>
<li>2 ripe tomatoes</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 clove garlic (~1 heaping tsp of minced garlic)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp thyme</li>
<li>1/2 basil</li>
<li>1 tbsp honey (can also use sugar if making for a baby who can’t have honey or
just leave out the sweetener all together if your tomatoes are sweet)</li>
<li>small handful of parsley</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>How to Make Zucchini Flan</p>
<ol>
<li>Steam your zucchini. There are lots of ways to do do this. I bring a little
bit of water to boil in a pot then insert a steamer basket with my zucchini
in it.</li>
<li>Slice up your zucchini very thin.</li>
<li>To make filling, cut up green onion very small and saute them with olive oil
until the pan sizzles slightly(this should be pretty short) and then turn
off and let cool by just abandoning the entire recipe and going and doing
something else (like making the tomato coulis).</li>
<li>When its cool mix together green onions, olive oil, eggs, sour cream, salt
and nutmeg.</li>
<li>Put wax paper in your casserole dish and spray so it doesn’t stick.</li>
<li>Place thin slices of zucchini until it covers the dish in one layer and
cover by pouring a thin layer of egg and creme mixture on top of it. Add
another layer of zucchini and cover with egg and creme mixture. Keep doing
this until you are out of zucchini. I usually do about 2.8 layers with not
quite enough zucchini to do a complete 3rd layer and then just pour the rest
of the creme mixture over the top.</li>
<li>Spread cheese over the top of this.</li>
<li>Put in oven and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30-40 minutes. Its done
when the cheese is slightly light brown and your mouth is watering.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to Make the Tomato Coulis</p>
<ol>
<li>Dice tomatoes and put in saucepan with olive oil on stove.</li>
<li>Add the other ingredients.</li>
<li>Warm up the pan until it seems that the contents are hot. Then turn off and
remove from heat. Let cool. You don’t want to cook it too much because then
it gets too mushy we just want it slightly cooked.</li>
<li>Serve this on top of the zucchini flan and place a little bit of parsley on
top to make it look great.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to Serve
I like to serve this with the zucchini flan warm and the Tomato coulis not warm
but eat it whatever temperature you want really. If anyone objects about the
temperature of the food confidently tell them that its supposed to be served
that temperature. Cut a piece of the zucchini flan and then spoon a little bit
of Tomato Coulis on top. Then sprinkle/arrange the parsley on top and admire
your zucchini flan.</p> </div> </article>  </div> </main> <footer class="border-t border-slate-200/80"> <div class="container flex items-center justify-between py-6 text-sm text-muted"> <span>© 2025 Escape To The Kitchen</span> </div> </footer> </div> </body></html>
