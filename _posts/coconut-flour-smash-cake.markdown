Coconut Flour Cake

Ingredients:
* 1 cup coconut flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 10 large eggs
* 1 cup butter
* 1 & 1/2 cups coconut sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 tsp lemon juice

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, grease and line pans with parchment paper

2. In a small bowl, sift all the dry ingredients together and set aside. 

3. Separate 4 of the eggs (yolks from the whites), setting the whites aside.

4. In a large bowl whisk together the 6 remaining whole eggs, 4 egg yolks, butter, coconut sugar, vanilla and lemon juice until they are well combined.
   
5. Then whisk in the flour mixture till completely smooth, with no lumps.

6. In another bowl beat the egg whites we separated earlier until soft peaks form (looks like softly whipped cream). Gently fold the egg whites into the batter till there are only a few streaks of whites visible.

7. Pour into prepared cake pan and bake 20-25 minutes or until the tops springs back when lightly pressed. Allow the cakes to cool for 5-10 minutes, then carefully remove from the pans and cool completely.
