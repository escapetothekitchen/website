This is tasty. Most recipes for spinach artichoke dip call for Mozzarella cheese. One day I didn't have any and substituted the cheeses that I did have. And it was delicious! I will always make it like this now.

* 8 oz. cream cheese, well softened
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
* 2.5 oz of shredded Monterey Jack cheese
* 2.5oz of shredded Pepper Jack cheese
* 2.5 oz of shredded Mild Cheddar cheese
* 1 (12 oz) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
* 6 oz. frozen spinach, thawed
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* 1/2 tbsp of butter

Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2.  Grease a pan and pour frozen spinach in. Place in oven while it preheats. This will thaw and cook your spinach a little.
3.  Chop up your artichoke hearts
4.  Shred your cheese.
5.  Combine all ingredients, including the spinach you put in the oven earlier.
    Leave about half of your parmesan cheese to the side for later.
6.  Grease your pan with the butter.
7.  Pour into baking dish.
8.  Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese on top.
9.  Bake for about 35 minutes or until the top is golden.
10. Enjoy with chips, toasted bread, sliced veggies, or whatever you want really.
