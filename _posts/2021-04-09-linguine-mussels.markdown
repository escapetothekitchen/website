Really really good. This dish looks fancy. I want to try it with clams or
shrimp. I bet it would be good.

Ingredients
* Linguine pasta ( I prefer bronze cut if you can get it) (16 oz)
* Mussels (12 oz)
* Bacon about 4-5 strips
* 3 heaping tbsps sundried tomatoes
* 1/4 cup mushrooms
* ~1 cup white wine
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
* 2 really large pinches of parmesan
* herbs ( parseley, basil, oregano, thyme, whatever you have really)

Directions
1. To cook/heat the mussels, place mussels in a saucepan with the butter and
   cover the bottom with the white wine. I used the cheapest white wine I have
   (aldi wine). Turn on high heat and cover essentially boiling/steaming the
   mussels for 6 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, cook your linguine.
3. Cook bacon and break into tiny pieces.
4. Dice your mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.
5. When your mussels are done turn off heat. With the pan still hot, add in the
   mushrooms, heavy whipping cream, pepper and herbs. Cook for a few minutes.
6. Add the cooked linguine to the pan along with the bacon, sundried tomatoes,
   and parmesan and any more seasoning you think it needs.
7. Stir well. There might be a little bit of liquidy sauce in the bottom of the
   pan. Keep stirring to distribute that sauce. As it cools, it should thicken
   up.
   Protip: Remove broken shells as you go because they are a bit dangerous when
   you are trying to eat.
