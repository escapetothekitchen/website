I have a complicated relationship with deviled eggs. The way most people make
them they are pretty meh and I don't understand why anyone likes them. In
contrast these Deviled eggs are badass and loaded!

Ingredients:

* eggs
* mayonaise
* grssfed butter
* dijon mustard
* relish
* sweet onions
* salt
* pepper
* paprika
* vinegar

Directions:

They look better if you make an amount that actually fits the number of holes on
the serving plate. I should have made 1 more egg. Learn from my mistake. Count your
holes.
