The perfect soup for fall. It tastes like festive seasoning!

Ingredients ( Makes about 4 servings)

* 8 oz of homemade chicken bone broth/stock (or you can use store bought or
  beef or vegetable broth, but it will change the flavor)
* 12 oz of water
* 8 oz of pumpkin (pureed) doesn't matter how the pumkin is cooked - boiled,
  steamed, in a can is all fine. You can add more pumpking than this if you
  want a more bold pumpkin flavor.
* 1/4 onion finely chopped
* 1 potato (I prefer red potatoes but any potato will do)
* 1 large carrot
* 1 clove of garlic
* Salt and pepper to taste (if needed)
* 1/2 cup of whipping cream/ half & half/ heavy whipping cream
* 1/2 cooked bacon to serve (optional)

Directions

1.  Put bone broth/ stock in a pot and add about half the water. Bring to boil.
2.  While thats coming to a boil, either shred or finely dice your onions,
    carrots, and potatoes.
3.  Add vegetables to pot. When it is boiling reduce to a simmer.
4.  Add pumpkin, garlic, and the rest of the water.
5.  Cook a little while. ( about 10 minutes)
6.  Add cream and stir thouroughly adding salt and pepper to taste. Start with
    about 1/4 tsp of each). Make sure its cooking on low. Cook for about 20
    minutes.
7.  If you aren't a vegetarian/ have bacon and want to eat it, while the soup
    is simmering, cook up little pieces of bacon in a pan and pour the bacon
    fat into the soup.
8.  By this time the soup should be done. Taste it. Is it delicious? If not add
    salt/pepper/cream until its delicious.
9.  Serve in a bowl and sprinkle little pieces of bacon on top (if you made
    some). If you want to be fancy you can also add a dollop of sour
    cream/cream fraiche and chives/parsely on top.
10. Enjoy!

Yum!
