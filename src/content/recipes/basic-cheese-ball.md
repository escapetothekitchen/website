A basic cheese ball.

Ingredients
* 1 pack of cream cheese (8 oz), softened
* 1/2 lb sharp cheddar cheese (finely shredded)
* 2-3 stalks chopped green onion
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tsp dried garlic
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* Optional: 1/2 cup mixed nuts

Directions

1. Take out cream cheese and allow to warm up 30 minutes to an hour before starting. (This makes the cream cheese easier to combine with the other ingredients)
2. Finely dice 2-3 green onion (depending on size of stalk how many you should use)
3. Finely shred your sharp cheddar cheese. (If you didn't buy the preshredded)
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, green onion, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and black pepper to the cheese mixture. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
5. Using your hands, form the cheese mixture into a ball shape. (This can be stored overnight)
6. Put mixed nuts in a food processor to finely chop them.
7. Pour nuts into a dish and roll the cheese ball around until it is completely covered. 
8. Serve.
