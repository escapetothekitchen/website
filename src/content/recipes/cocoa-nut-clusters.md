These Cocoa-Nut Clusters are great date snacks or a dessert. I first came up
with this recipe when I was pregnant and trying to eat 6 dates a day. These are
great for when you need to eat dates but are tired of the taste of dates. And
since dates are used as the primary sweetener you don't have to add any regular
sugar to them.

Ingredients
* 10 Dates
* 1 cup chopped up nuts (I prefer almonds)
* 4 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut flakes
* 3 tbsp coconut oil
* maple syrup (to taste) (I prefer about 2 tbsp but feel free to leave out
  entirely if you want)
* serving sticks (optional)
* if your nuts are salt free than also add a bit of salt as well

Instructions
1. Pit dates and put dates and nuts in food processor until chopped up.
2. Add other ingredients and mix. This step can be done in the food processor
   if you want compact clusters or you can finish mixing outside the food
   processor if you want more textured clusters.
3. Form into balls and put on wax paper (or cookie sheet or something)
4. Place in fridge for an hour or 2 to set. Keep refrigerated or they melt! If
   you want to make them extra festive stick them on serving sticks.
