Ingredients
* 1 banana
* 2 eggs
* vanilla extract (optional)
* salt (to taste)



Recommended Toppings
* butter
* honey
* peanut butter


Instructions
1. Preheat electric griddle to 250Â°F (or use a stove).
2. Place banana and eggs into a blender and blend on low (about 10 seconds).
3. Spread butter on your pan or griddle and pour batter in. Each batch should
   make 6-8 small pancakes.
4. Flip as soon as the pancakes are firm enough to not break. These will be
   more fragile than a normal pancake, and will take more time to cook. Be
   patient.
5. Melt butter on pancakes during the last few seconds before serving
