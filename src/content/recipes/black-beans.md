For me black beans are the sort of dish that are very hit or miss. Sometimes I
have them and I think meh"" but other times I have them and they are delicious."

With this recipe I think I've finally identified what can make them delicious
every time. One concern with beans is upset stomach and gas. Other people are
concerned about the phytic acid content of beans. With this recipe
beans for 24 hours and changing the water helps eliminate this problem. Â Cooking
in a pressure cooker also helps with the breakdown of them as well. I am able to
eat these beans with no tummy troubles at all.

Ingredients

* 2 cups of dried black beans
* 8 oz chicken bone broth (can substitute vegetable broth for vegetarian dish)
* 1 bell pepper (Get creative here! Use green
  peppers or a combination of several)
* 1 small onion
* ~ tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 clove of minced garlic
* 1 tsp salt ( or to taste)
* 1/2 tsp pepper ( or to taste)
* 1 bay leaf

For spicy beans:

* can of chili peppers

Topping:

* sour cream or cheese!

Directions

1. Put dried black beans in a bowl and cover in filtered clean water. Soak for
   24 hours
2. Put olive oil in bottom of pressure cooker pot so beans don't stick. Pour
   your black beans in a presure cooker (I use a instapot
   cooker will work). Add in peppers
   seasonings and cover with water.
3. Cook for about 10 minutes under pressure.
4. Remove lid and continue to cook on low until it has thickened up and is
   right consistency.
5. Enjoy with sour cream on top. If you want them spicy then add a can of green
   chilis or some hot sauce.
