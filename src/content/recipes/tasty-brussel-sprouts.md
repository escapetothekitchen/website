- 4 tbsp white wine
- apple cider vinegar

Directions:

2. Chop up the peppers and onions.
3. Cut raw bacon slices into about 2 inches lengths and cook them in large cast iron skillet.
4. When bacon is almost done add onions and peppers and cook on low to caramalize.
5. Add brussel sprouts and garlic and turn up the heat.
6. Constantly stirring add the wine, apple cider vinegar and the rest of the spices.
