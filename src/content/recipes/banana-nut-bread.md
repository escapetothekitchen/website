Ingredients

* Cooking spray for the pan (I use avocado oil spray)
* 3 large really ripe bananas 
* 1 cup blanched almond flour
* 1 cup flour
* 3 large eggs
* 1/3 coconut sugar
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* 2 tbsp butter, melted
* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
* 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 cup walnuts, crushed
* 1/4 cup chocolate chips

Directions

1. Mix all the ingredients together. Start by squishing up your banana then add
   other wet ingredients (butter, brown sugar, sugar, vanilla
   extract, eggs). Mix in the dry ingredients (cinnamon, flour, almond flour,
   baking powder, salt). Lastly add in chopped up walnuts and chocolate chips. ( It actually works better if you add the chocolate chips after you have already poured it into the baking pan because then the chocolate chips don't all end up on the bottom.)
2. Grease your baking pan well and pour batter into loaf pan.
3. Bake at 350 degrees for 45-55 minutes.
