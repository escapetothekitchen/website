Frosting vs icing. I know I have trouble remembering the difference. Frosting is
usually thicker and is spread on or piping onto the cake. Icing is runnier and
sometimes hardens onto the cake and is often poured onto the cake or drizzled.

Beets are a great way to color something bright pink fairly easily without the
use of artificial color.

Ingredients

* 2 cups of butter
* 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
* 3 cups powdered confectioners sugar
* 4 tsp vanilla
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 4 tbsp arrowroot powder/flour
* 1/2 cup raspberry jam
* cooked beets

Directions

1. Soften your butter to room temperature completely.
2. Add your heavy whipping cream, butter, confectioners sugar, vanilla, lemon
   juice, and raspberry jam to mixing bowl.
3. Beat until smooth.
4. Add in arrowroot powder to thicken, mix again.
5. To achieve deeper pink color take cooked beats and put in food processor
   until pretty much pulverized. Drain through seive. Take the juice that comes
   through the sieve and add spoonful by spoonful to frosting while mixing
   until it turns the desired pink color.
