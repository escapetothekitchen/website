# Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting

## Ingredients
- 1 package (8 oz) cream cheese
- 1 lb unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until fluffy.
2. Add the heavy whipping cream, cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla extract to the bowl, and beat until well combined.
3. Attempt to sift your powdered sugar so that your buttercream is smooth and decadent. After sifting 2 cups, lose patience and give up sifting.
4. Mix in (somewhat) sifted powdered sugar slowly and in increments and then add in the milk until the desired consistency is reached. 
5. Transfer frosting to a piping bag or large zip top bag and frost your completely cooled cupcakes/cake.
